# Machine Translation using Hugging Face Transformers

This project demonstrates **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face. It translates English sentences to German using the **Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-de** model.


## What is Machine Translation?

**Machine Translation (MT)** is the task of automatically translating text from one language to another. It's used in tools like Google Translate.


## Tech Stack

- Python 
- Transformers Library
- Pre-trained MarianMTModel
- Torch (PyTorch backend)
- SentencePiece Tokenizer


## Sample output:

Input: Good morning!
Translated: Guten Morgen!
