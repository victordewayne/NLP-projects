# Text Generation with GPT-2 | Hugging Face Transformers

This project demonstrates **text generation** using a pre-trained **GPT-2 language model** from the Hugging Face Transformers library. Language models like GPT-2 can generate human-like text based on a given prompt, making them useful in applications such as chatbots, story generation, content creation, and more.

## Example Output

## Input prompt
"Artificial Intelligence will"

## Output
Artificial Intelligence will be our next frontier, and we will do so in real time, not through algorithms, but through the tools we have already developed and are developing and using here at DeepMind.

"The future of AI is clear,"
