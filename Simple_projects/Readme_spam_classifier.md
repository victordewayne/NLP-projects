# Spam Detection using Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates a simple **text classification** model using **Naive Bayes** to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages.


## Overview

- Uses `CountVectorizer` to convert text into feature vectors.
- Applies `Multinomial Naive Bayes` from scikit-learn.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Outputs model accuracy.


## Requirements

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Sample output

Accuracy:  1.0
