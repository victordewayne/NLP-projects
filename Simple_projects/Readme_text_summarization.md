# Text Summarization (Extractive & Abstractive)

This project demonstrates two fundamental techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for summarizing text: **Extractive Summarization** and **Abstractive Summarization**.

## Overview

Text summarization is the process of automatically generating a shorter version of a given text while retaining the most important information.

There are two primary types:

- **Extractive Summarization:**  
  Selects and extracts key sentences or phrases directly from the original text without modifying them.  
  (Think of it like copying & pasting important lines.)

- **Abstractive Summarization:**  
  Generates new sentences that paraphrase the main idea of the original text using deep learning models.  
  (Like how humans summarize in their own words.)

## Sample output

Extractive:
    It involves enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human lan, interpret, and generate human language.
With the advent of deep learning, models like BERT, GPT, and T5 have pushed the boundaries of what machines can understand and generate.
These advancements have significantly improved tasks like question answering, summarization, and contextual understanding.

Abstractive:
    Summary: natural language processing is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the interaction between humans and computers using natural language . it involves enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
