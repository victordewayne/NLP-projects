# TF-IDF Text Analysis

This project demonstrates how to compute TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores for words in multiple documents. TF-IDF helps identify important words in text processing and is widely used in search engines, keyword extraction, and NLP tasks.

# Features
- Tokenizes text and removes stopwords.
- Computes TF-IDF scores for words in different documents.
- Identifies important keywords based on their significance.
